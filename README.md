# Narcissistic-number-checker
A  Narcissistic is a number where the sum of each digit to the power of the number of digits is the number.

For example:

371 is a narcissistic number because:

3^3 = 27
7^3 = 343
1^3 = 1

27 + 343 + 1 = 371

This algorithm determines whether a number is  Narcissistic
